Still trying to learn Haskell !!
But have fallen into a rabbit hole .... the theory of 
programming languages. Wow.

So .... this project is about operational semanics 
(I think) ... based on some Cambridge Uni notes.

Aim is to implement a SCM machine for a simple language. 

So off we go ......

## Testing
Try to implement some basic tests ...

 - Edited `package.yaml` to add `containers` and `transformers`
 - Added `hspec` in test dependencies in `package.yaml`
 - Couple of basic tests added ... Works ok
